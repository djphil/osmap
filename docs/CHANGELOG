Google maps API v3 interface for OpenSim. (See demo at http://talatchaudhri.info/demo/opensimmaps/v3/)
Based on pre-existing (2008) Google maps API v2 interface for OpenSim. (See demo at http://talatchaudhri.com/demo/opensimmaps/v2/)

Given that GMaps v2 is deprecated and will be withdrawn in 2013, upgraded to v3. As the v3 API is radically different, only a core of the code was portable, so wrote substantial new replacement code.

Various bug fixes and maintenance e.g. map centre, local defaults, links and link protocols.
Re-wrote the info window script and added a draggable/clickable marker, limited within map tile boundaries.
Added multiple centre locations and/or servers.
Added multiple map data copyright support for multiple servers.
Added home button functionality missing in GMaps v3 controls.
Added more configurable user settings than previously added to v2 version.
Added: user setting for initial zoom size.
Support for uuid-based and opensim-based tile filenames (can update automatically from OpenSim server).
Created fake PHP5 DOM script returning XML to enable test instance independent of OpenSim server live XML.
Back-ported DOM script to PHP4 (using older php_domxml) so it can run on PHP4.
Fixed: minor marker setup bug.
Cleaned up code and added comments for documentation.
Added README.
Unfixable (minor): marker hover incorrect on drag if not moved off marker and returned: no JS solution, apparently a browser issue.
Re-wrote to support large regions e.g. varregions in OpenSim/Aurora/WhiteCore
Added offsets from map centre
Improved home centering per map centre
Added zoom levels for each  map centre
Added automatic copyright start/end years

To do (features):
add switchable grid map background with grid locations (& sort out how background is done)
move set up user settings into XML and use parser to initialise
